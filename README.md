# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

  Louise wants to compare different Kickstarter campaigns to have a better understanding of how to approach a campaign for her play fever. I completed an analysis on different Kickstarter campaigns related to theater to explain the different outcomes based on Launch Date and the Goal. This analyis also incl

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

  To complete this part of the analysis I created a pivot table from the Kickstarter data sheet using Successful, Failed and Canceled as the columns and the months of the year as the rows. The graph shows how many Kickstarters fall in each category month over month. There is also a filter set for the Parent Category to be theater so we are only showing the data that is related to the play Louise is working on, and a filter for Years if the data needs to be broken down further. This pivot table was used to create the pivot chart to help visualize what the data is telling.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

1. The most successful Theater Campaigns happen in May and trend downward for the rest of year, outside of a minor increase in October.

2. The least successful Theater Campaigns happen in November, but there are consistently more successful Theater Campaigns than failed Theater Campaigns month over month. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

Theater Campaigns for plays are most successful when the goal is less than $1000.00. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
